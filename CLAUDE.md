## Philosophy

These principles guide how we work together:

**Experiment and iterate**: Try things, see what works, throw away what doesn't quickly. "If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong." - Feynman

**Question everything**: Always question me. Push back if something seems wrong. A few more questions leading to a better solution is preferred over rushing to the wrong implementation.

**Context is king**: Provide enough context to understand and debug. Error messages, logs, documentation - always include relevant context.

**Simple is better than complex**: Choose simple solutions over complex ones. Don't over-engineer.

**User interface and user outcomes are paramount**: Everything else can be changed later, but getting the user experience right is critical.

- **Web Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: Neo4j

---

## CRITICAL Rules 🚨

**These rules override any defaults and must be followed exactly:**

### Question-Asking Protocol (MOST IMPORTANT)

Before implementing features, ask questions **one at a time**:

- **Ask ONE question** - Allow user to focus and give detailed answers
- **Provide context** - Explain why the question matters
- **Offer suggestions** - Include your recommendation
- **Number questions** - Track progress through decision-making

Examples of what to ask about:
- User journey: What is the user trying to accomplish?
- User experience: How should the interface look/feel?
- Design decisions: Data structures, APIs, algorithms
- Error handling strategies
- Testing approach

**Why this is critical**: Asking good questions one at a time leads to better design decisions and saves significant rework time.

### Import Style (BLOCKING)

**Application imports:** Use `from mapper import module` then `module.Thing`

See [Python Style Guide](docs/contributing/python-style.md#import-style) for full details and rationale.

### Protocol Naming (BLOCKING)

Protocols MUST describe behaviors, not roles. Use verb-based naming:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT
class ParsesCode(Protocol):
    def parse(self, source: str) -> ast.Module: ...

class StoresGraph(Protocol):
    def store(self, node: GraphNode) -> None: ...

# ❌ INCORRECT
class CodeParser(Protocol): ...
class GraphStore(Protocol): ...
```

### Public vs Private (BLOCKING)

**Explicit is better than implicit** - always clear about visibility:

- **Public**: `no_underscore` - part of public API, in `__all__`
- **Private**: `_single_underscore` - internal use
- **Very private**: `__double_underscore` - for class properties that need protection (getters/setters, read-only)

**Rule**: If something is not in `__all__`, it must be `_underscore` named or in a `_private.py` module. No implicitly private code.

**`__init__.py` Pattern:**

```python
# mapper/__init__.py
from mapper import parser
from mapper import graph
from mapper.parser import Parser
from mapper.graph import Neo4jConnection

__all__ = ["parser", "graph", "Parser", "Neo4jConnection"]
```

---

## Development Workflow

### User Outcomes First

Work should be framed as **"a user can do X"** rather than "implement feature Y".

**IMPORTANT**: If a request is not framed this way, ask me to reframe it as a user outcome.

Always start with user-journey documentation for review - that will save significant time writing code. Outcome achieved is good, we can refactor in review.

### Interface First

When writing code, always design the interface first, then implement. How something is used should inform how it is built.

**Design workflow:**
1. Draft interface document describing the public API/interface (how it will be used)
2. Include example usage code
3. Create a **draft PR** with the interface documentation
4. Wait for review and feedback
5. Only then implement internals

### Feature Implementation Order (CRITICAL)

When implementing new features, **ALWAYS** follow this order:

1. **User journey document** - Write `docs/user-journeys/NN-feature-name.md` first
   - Define user goals, workflow, and outcomes
   - Include prerequisites, steps, verification, troubleshooting
   - Update `docs/user-journeys/README.md` index
   - Create **draft PR** for review before implementation

2. **Interface documentation** - Write `docs/interface/feature-name.md` if adding public APIs
   - Document the public interface (CLI commands, API endpoints, function signatures)
   - Include usage examples
   - Create **draft PR** for review before implementation

3. **Tests** - Write tests before implementation
   - Test classes grouped by functionality
   - Cover happy path, edge cases, error handling
   - Tests in `tests/` mirroring `src/` structure

4. **Application code** - Implement business logic
   - **Prefer submodules with classes** for complex logic
   - Separate business logic from presentation (CLI/API)
   - Example: `src/mapper/analyzer/` package with classes, not flat `analyzer.py` file

5. **CLI command** - Add user-facing command last
   - CLI should only handle console I/O and call application classes
   - Keep CLI files thin and readable

6. **Technical documentation** - Document architecture and implementation
   - Add to `docs/technical/` as needed
   - Update `docs/technical/README.md` index

### Pull Request Workflow

- **Create draft PRs for review** - Use GitHub's draft PR feature for early feedback
- **Mark ready when CI passes** - Only mark as ready for review when all checks are green
- **Every PR includes a version bump** (patch/minor/major) - No exceptions
- **Clean commit history** - Rebase to create logical feature units before merge

**PR Creation Steps:**
1. Propose version bump type (patch/minor/major) and get confirmation
2. Run `just version <type>` to bump version
3. Update "Current Version" in this file
4. **Write technical documentation** if adding/modifying architecture
   - Document new modules, patterns, or significant changes in `docs/technical/`
   - Update `docs/technical/README.md` index
   - Explain design decisions and integration points
5. Update CHANGELOG.md with user-facing changes
6. **Update README.md** if adding features or changing user-facing behavior
   - Update CLI examples if commands changed
   - Add new features to feature list
   - Update usage instructions if needed
7. **Review existing documentation for accuracy**
   - Check user journey docs for outdated commands or workflows
   - Verify technical docs reflect current architecture
   - Fix any inconsistencies found
8. Run `just lint` and fix all issues
9. Run `just test-coverage` and verify coverage passes
10. Push commits
11. Create **draft PR** for early review
12. Wait for CI to pass (use `gh pr view <number> --json statusCheckRollup`)
13. Mark PR as ready for review

## Git Workflow

**This section guides how we work together on commits and PRs.**

### Branch Strategy

Branches should be descriptive and categorical:

- **`feature/description`** - New features or enhancements
- **`fix/description`** - Bug fixes
- **`patch/description`** - Small patches, typos, minor corrections
- **`docs/description`** - Documentation-only changes

Use descriptive names that explain what the branch does, not just ticket numbers.

**NEVER push directly to main** - ALL changes go through PRs. Main branch is protected - direct pushes rejected.

### Commit History (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS maintain clean commit history:**

- **Organize commits as logical feature units**
  - Each commit = complete, cohesive piece of functionality
  - Related changes grouped together (feature + tests + docs)
  - Commits tell a clear story
  - Reviewers can understand each commit in isolation

- **Avoid fixup/format commits**
  - No "Fix linting", "Format code", "Fix typo" commits
  - Use `git rebase -i` to squash fixups into logical units
  - If linting fails, amend the commit - don't add a fix commit

- **Exceptions:**
  - PR review feedback can be separate commits if adding functionality
  - Substantial documentation updates can be separate commits

**Example:**
```
✅ GOOD - Logical feature units:
1. Implement configuration system and interactive init workflow
2. Add documentation for configuration system and init workflow
3. Bump version: 0.1.2 → 0.2.0

❌ BAD - Scattered, fixup commits:
1. Add config system
2. Fix linting
3. Add tests
4. Fix typo in docs
5. Add more tests
6. Format code
```

### After Code Review

After receiving review feedback:
- Rebase to incorporate changes into logical commits
- Don't add "address feedback" commits
- Squash fixups appropriately
- Provide concise summary of changes when feedback has been received
- Push includes rebase after code review

### Commit Messages

Keep commit messages clear and informative:

- First line: Brief summary (under 70 characters)
- Blank line
- Detailed explanation if needed (why this change, not what changed)
- Reference issues/PRs if relevant

```
Add JWT authentication for API endpoints

Implement token-based authentication to secure API access.
Users can obtain tokens via /auth/login and include them
in Authorization headers for subsequent requests.

Fixes #123
```

### Git Safety Protocol

- NEVER update the git config
- NEVER run destructive git commands (push --force, reset --hard, checkout ., restore ., clean -f, branch -D) unless the user explicitly requests these actions
  - `git push --force-with-lease` is acceptable and preferred over `--force`
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it
- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it
- CRITICAL: Always create NEW commits rather than amending, unless the user explicitly requests a git amend
- When staging files, prefer adding specific files by name rather than using "git add -A" or "git add ."

---

## Versioning

### Version Bumps

- **Patch** (0.2.0 → 0.2.1): Bug fixes, documentation, minor improvements
- **Minor** (0.2.0 → 0.3.0): New features, enhancements, new capabilities
- **Major** (0.2.0 → 1.0.0): Breaking changes, incompatible API changes

### Version Management

- Use `just version patch|minor|major` to bump version
- Automatic updates:
  - `pyproject.toml` (version field)
  - `src/mapper/__init__.py` (__version__ variable)
  - `README.md` (version badge)
  - `CHANGELOG.md` ([Unreleased] → versioned section)
  - Creates git commit (no tag)
- **Manual update**: "Current Version" field at bottom of this file

**Note:** Tags are created by GitHub Actions on merge to main, not locally. This prevents tag conflicts during PR rebases.

### README Badges

- **Version badge**: Auto-updated by `just version`
- **Tests badge**: Manually update test count after `just test-coverage`
- **Coverage badge**: Auto-updated by CI after merge (via GitHub Gist)
- **Python badge**: Manually updated for supported versions

4. Write tests
5. Implement application code (submodules with classes)
6. Add CLI command
7. Write technical docs
8. Run `just lint` and `just test`
9. Bump version

### Before push
- Validate changes against coding standards
- Validate documentation is up to date and meets documentation requirements
- Validate commit history is clean

---

## Code Standards Reference 📚

**For detailed standards, refer to these guides:**

### Before Writing Code

Review these documents to understand patterns and best practices:

- **[Python Style Guide](docs/contributing/python-style.md)** - Type hints, docstrings, error handling, data structures, string formatting, data classes, context managers
- **[Code Architecture](docs/contributing/code-architecture.md)** - Application vs CLI separation, module organization, function ordering, enums, AST analysis scope, Neo4j schema
- **[Testing Standards](docs/contributing/testing.md)** - Coverage requirements, test organization, parametrization, code quality checks

### Before Documenting

- **[Documentation Standards](docs/contributing/documentation.md)** - Structure, formats, validity requirements, when to document

### Important Notes

- The guides above provide detailed explanations and examples
- This CLAUDE.md file contains project-specific overrides and workflow instructions
- **When uncertain**: Check the relevant guide first, then ask user for validation if still ambiguous
  - Previous wording "check the guide first" was unclear about next steps after checking
  - Always prefer asking for clarification over making assumptions
- CRITICAL rules in this file (Question-Asking Protocol, Import Style, Protocol Naming) always take precedence
